## Layout Components
React components that deal primarily with arranging other components on the page.

## Container Components
React components that take care of loading and managing data for their child components.

## Uncontrolled Components
React components that keep track of their own states and release data only when some event occurs (that is, the submit event for HTML forms)

## Controlled Components
React components that do not keep track of their own states. All state is passed in as props (that is, when we use the useState hook with text inputs)

## Higher-Order Components
A component that returns another component instead of JSX.
